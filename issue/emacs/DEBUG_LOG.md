**Issue Reference:** `issue/emacs/001.txt`  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Current Status:** In Progress

## Session Log

### Session 2025-08-08
**Objective:**
Reproduce the failing "Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line" error and collect initial diagnostics.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Verified `exec-sql-parser.el` loads by checking for balanced parentheses.
2. Invoked the parser on a multi-line `EXEC SQL` block lacking a terminating semicolon.

**Commands Run / Observations:**
```bash
emacs --batch exec-sql-parser.el -f check-parens
```
_Output:_  
```
Unmatched bracket or quote
```

```bash
make e-eval
```
_Output:_  
```
Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line
```

**Reasoning / Analysis:**
- The parser file initially failed to load due to an unmatched parenthesis, which was corrected by adding a closing paren.
- Once loadable, the parser signaled an unterminated multi-line statement when no end marker was present.

**Partial Findings:**
- The parser depends on a regex `:end-pattern` to detect statement termination.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Need clarity on how multi-line blocks should terminate.

**Next Steps for Future Session:**
- Inspect termination logic within `exec-sql-parser-parse`.
- Add tests for edge cases around multi-line termination.

### Session 2025-08-08-2
**Objective:**
Examine parser termination logic and document a reproducible failure.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Ran `make e-eval` and captured the full stack trace.
2. Reviewed `exec-sql-parser-parse` implementation to understand how termination is handled.

**Commands Run / Observations:**
```bash
make e-eval
```
_Output:_  
```
Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line
make: *** [Makefile:8: e-eval] Error 255
```

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' exec-sql-parser.el | head
```
_Output:_  
```
;;; exec-sql-parser.el --- Parse EXEC SQL blocks -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
...
```

**Reasoning / Analysis:**
- `exec-sql-parser-parse` enters an `inside` state when encountering `EXEC SQL` and expects an `:end-pattern` match to exit.
- Without a terminating semicolon, the parser reaches EOF and raises an error.

**Partial Findings:**
- The current logic cannot gracefully handle EOF for unfinished multi-line statements.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Decide whether EOF should be treated as termination or whether error messaging needs improvement.

**Next Steps for Future Session:**
- Develop unit tests for multi-line statements with and without terminators.
- Explore modifications to handle EOF cases.

### Session 2025-08-08-3
**Objective:**
Add regression test for unterminated multi-line `EXEC SQL` blocks and confirm current failure.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Implemented a pytest capturing an `EXEC SQL` block missing a semicolon.
2. Executed the new test and existing suite.

**Commands Run / Observations:**
```bash
make e-eval
```
_Output:_
```
Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_capture_exec_sql.py::test_unterminated_multi_line -q
```
_Output:_
```
.
1 passed in 0.02s
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
```
_Output:_
```
5 passed in 0.05s
```

**Reasoning / Analysis:**
- Python-side `capture_exec_sql_blocks` mirrors Emacs parser by raising a `ValueError` when EOF is reached without matching the `end_pattern`.
- The new test documents the failure mode for unfinished multi-line statements.

**Partial Findings:**
- The parser currently requires an explicit terminator; missing semicolons trigger a predictable error now covered by tests.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Need a strategy to gracefully handle EOF or provide clearer guidance on required terminators.

**Next Steps for Future Session:**
- Investigate options for interpreting EOF as block termination.
- Evaluate improving error messaging or registry configuration.

### Session 2025-08-08-4
**Objective:**
Allow EOF to terminate multi-line `EXEC SQL` blocks and adjust tests.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Removed hard error at EOF in both Emacs and Python parsers.
2. Updated Python test to expect capturing rather than a `ValueError`.
3. Re-ran unit tests and Emacs evaluation.

**Commands Run / Observations:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
```
_Output:_
```
.....
5 passed in 0.04s
```

```bash
make e-eval
```
_Output:_
```
[no output, exited 0]
```

**Reasoning / Analysis:**
- Treating EOF as implicit terminator prevents the previous exception.
- Python side now captures the unfinished block and inserts a marker.

**Partial Findings:**
- Emacs parser no longer errors but currently returns no captured blocks; behavior may need refinement.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Verify Emacs parser returns captured block content.

**Next Steps for Future Session:**
- Investigate why Emacs parser yields empty result and align its output with Python implementation.

### Session 2025-08-08-5
**Objective:**
Explore invoking handler actions at EOF so unfinished blocks are captured.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Tried calling the registered `:action` when EOF is reached.
2. Refactored `exec-sql-parser.el`, but `funcall` on `#'identity` raised `invalid-function` and subsequent edits led to unmatched parentheses.

**Commands Run / Observations:**
```bash
emacs --batch -Q -l exec-sql-parser.el --eval "(exec-sql-parser-parse \"EXEC SQL\nSELECT * FROM t\")"
```
_Output:_
```
Invalid function: #'identity
```

**Reasoning / Analysis:**
- Registry stores actions quoted as `#'identity`, yielding a cons cell from `plist-get` that `funcall` can't execute directly.
- Manual refactoring became error-prone, so changes were reverted.

**Partial Findings:**
- Action functions may need evaluation before invocation.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Emacs parser still fails to return block content at EOF.

**Next Steps for Future Session:**
- Determine how to evaluate registry actions safely.
- Rework parser structure while keeping parentheses balanced.

## Summary of Progress
- Key discoveries so far:  
  - Parser now loads correctly after fixing unmatched parenthesis.  
  - Multi-line statements lacking a semicolon trigger an "Unterminated" error due to missing `:end-pattern` match.
- Current hypothesis:  
  - Parser needs explicit handling for EOF in multi-line statements or clearer requirements for terminators.
