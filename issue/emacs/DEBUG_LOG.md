### Goals
- Reproduce failing "Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line" test and collect initial diagnostics.

### Actions
- Attempted to run `(exec-sql-parser-parse ...)` using Emacs in batch mode, but loading `exec-sql-parser.el` raised `end-of-file` due to unbalanced parentheses.
- Executed `emacs --batch exec-sql-parser.el -f check-parens` which reported "Unmatched bracket or quote".
- Wrote a small Python script to locate the unmatched position, identifying an open parenthesis at the start of `exec-sql-parser-parse` (char 2652, ~line 87).
- Added a missing closing parenthesis at the end of `exec-sql-parser.el` and re-ran `check-parens`, which succeeded.
- With the file loadable, invoked the parser on a multi-line `EXEC SQL` block lacking a terminating semicolon. Emacs signaled `Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line`, producing a stack trace.

### Results
- Parser file now loads without syntax errors.
- The targeted failing scenario reproduces reliably via batch invocation, yielding the expected error message and stack trace.

### Next Steps
- Analyze which portion of the parser determines block termination.
- Investigate edge cases for multi-line SQL blocks and develop unit tests.
- Implement parser fixes once root cause is identified.
