# Debug Log

## 2025-08-08
- Encountered failing Emacs test `exec-sql-parser-captures-execute-variants` reporting `Unterminated EXEC SQL STATEMENT-Multi-Line`.
- Investigated `exec-sql-parser.el` registry patterns; discovered improper use of `\s*` and `\S` which are invalid in Emacs regex.
- Updated whitespace tokens to `\s-` and `\S-` and anchored `EXECUTE-Block` end pattern.
- Despite updates, test still reports `Unterminated EXEC SQL EXECUTE-Block`; further investigation needed into termination handling for `EXECUTE-Block` constructs.
