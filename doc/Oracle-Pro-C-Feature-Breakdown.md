### Deep Dive Analysis of Oracle Pro*C Features

Oracle Pro*C is a programming interface that embeds SQL directly into C code, allowing seamless interaction with Oracle databases. The complexity of its features ranges from simple SQL queries to advanced database operations and runtime constructs.

Below is a breakdown of Oracle Pro*C features, categorized from simplest to most complex to implement support, focusing on **capturing and restoring embedded SQL** rather than formatting.

---

### **1. Simple SQL Statements**
#### Description:
- Basic SQL statements embedded in C code.
- Typically single-line or straightforward to parse.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL SELECT COUNT(*) INTO :count FROM employees;
EXEC SQL DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :id;
```

#### Complexity: **Low**
- No multi-line parsing required.
- End of statement is easily detected by the semicolon (`;`).

#### Implementation:
- Capture the entire line as a single block.
- Restore as-is with appropriate indentation.

---

### **2. Multi-Line SQL Statements**
#### Description:
- SQL statements spanning multiple lines, often due to formatting or complexity.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    INTO :firstName, :lastName
    FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = :id;
```

#### Complexity: **Low-Medium**
- Requires proper detection of statement boundaries (ends with `;`).
- Indentation of subsequent lines should be relative to the first line.

#### Implementation:
- Capture all lines until the terminating `;`.
- Restore the multi-line structure, respecting the original alignment.

---

### **3. Declared Variables (`DECLARE SECTION`)**
#### Description:
- SQL variables declared in a `DECLARE SECTION`, used for parameter binding.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int employee_id;
    char employee_name[100];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

#### Complexity: **Medium**
- Enclosed by `BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `END DECLARE SECTION`.
- Content must be restored as a cohesive block, preserving the `DECLARE SECTION` syntax.

#### Implementation:
- Wrap the entire section as a single block during capture.
- Properly restore `BEGIN` and `END` statements with the original variable definitions.

---

### **4. Dynamic SQL (Host Variables)**
#### Description:
- Allows dynamic construction and execution of SQL at runtime.
- Host variables are used to pass values to or retrieve values from SQL statements.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt FROM :query;
EXEC SQL EXECUTE stmt USING :var1, :var2;
```

#### Complexity: **Medium**
- Requires proper handling of host variables (`:var`).
- Capture and restore both the SQL statement and associated host variables.

#### Implementation:
- Treat each dynamic statement as a separate block.
- Ensure host variables are preserved during restoration.

---

### **5. SQL Cursor Management**
#### Description:
- Cursors enable row-by-row processing of SQL query results.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL DECLARE emp_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;
EXEC SQL OPEN emp_cursor;
EXEC SQL FETCH emp_cursor INTO :id, :firstName, :lastName;
EXEC SQL CLOSE emp_cursor;
```

#### Complexity: **Medium-High**
- Multi-step process with dependencies (e.g., `DECLARE`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, `CLOSE`).
- Cursors may involve multiple host variables and SQL operations.

#### Implementation:
- Capture the entire lifecycle (e.g., `DECLARE` to `CLOSE`) as related blocks.
- Preserve host variable bindings and sequence of operations.

---

### **6. PL/SQL Blocks**
#### Description:
- Embeds procedural SQL (PL/SQL) blocks within C code for complex logic.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL EXECUTE BEGIN
    DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = :dept_id;
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name) VALUES (:id, :name);
END;
```

#### Complexity: **High**
- Multi-line and contains nested SQL operations.
- Includes PL/SQL syntax like `BEGIN`, `END`, and exception handling.

#### Implementation:
- Treat the entire PL/SQL block as a single unit.
- Ensure proper parsing of nested SQL statements and procedural constructs.

---

### **7. Conditional and Iterative Constructs**
#### Description:
- Embeds conditional (e.g., `IF`) and iterative (e.g., `LOOP`) logic using PL/SQL.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL EXECUTE BEGIN
    IF :salary > 50000 THEN
        UPDATE employees SET bonus = bonus + 1000 WHERE employee_id = :id;
    END IF;
END;
```

#### Complexity: **High**
- Complex nesting of logic within the PL/SQL block.
- Requires robust handling of nested structures.

#### Implementation:
- Capture the block as a single unit.
- Preserve the logical structure during restoration.

---

### **8. Host Variable Arrays and Bulk Operations**
#### Description:
- Use of host variable arrays for bulk processing of data.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL FOR :n_rows INSERT INTO employees VALUES (:id_array, :name_array);
EXEC SQL FETCH emp_cursor FOR :n_rows INTO :id_array, :name_array;
```

#### Complexity: **High**
- Requires tracking of array dimensions (`:n_rows`) and bindings (`:id_array`, `:name_array`).
- Bulk operations may span multiple lines or statements.

#### Implementation:
- Capture bulk operations with associated host variables.
- Restore with original array references and dimensions intact.

---

### **9. Runtime Error and Exception Handling**
#### Description:
- Captures and handles runtime database errors using SQLCA or custom error codes.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR GOTO handle_error;
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO employees VALUES (:id, :name);
handle_error:
    printf("SQL Error occurred.\n");
```

#### Complexity: **High**
- Requires context-aware handling of error directives (`WHENEVER SQLERROR`).
- Links SQL statements to custom error handlers in C code.

#### Implementation:
- Treat error handling directives and their associated blocks as a cohesive unit.
- Preserve error handling logic during restoration.

---

### **10. Complex Nested Structures**
#### Description:
- Combination of PL/SQL, dynamic SQL, cursors, and host variables in a single construct.

#### Examples:
```c
EXEC SQL EXECUTE BEGIN
    DECLARE emp_cursor CURSOR FOR
        SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees;
    OPEN emp_cursor;
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cursor INTO :id, :name;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        INSERT INTO employee_log VALUES (:id, :name);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
```

#### Complexity: **Very High**
- Involves multi-level nesting and dependencies between SQL statements.
- Combines multiple features like cursors, PL/SQL, and host variables.

#### Implementation:
- Capture nested structures as hierarchies of blocks.
- Ensure seamless restoration of all components in the correct order.

### Recommendations
Start with simpler constructs like single-line SQL and declared variables. Gradually move to more complex features such as cursors, PL/SQL blocks, and error handling. Ensure robust capturing and restoration for each category before progressing to the next. Let me know which feature you'd like to implement support for first!
