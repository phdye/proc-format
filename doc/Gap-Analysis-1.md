### **Feature Breakdown vs. Current Implementation**

| **Feature**                      | **Complexity** | **Implemented in `proc-format.py`?**                                                                                                                                                 | **Notes for Enhancement**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Simple SQL Statements**     | Low            | **Yes**                                                                                                                                                                             | Fully supported. Single-line `EXEC SQL` statements are detected, captured, and restored correctly.                                                                                                                         |
| **2. Multi-Line SQL Statements** | Low-Medium     | **Partially**                                                                                                                                                                       | Multi-line SQL statements are captured and restored, but alignment improvements were recently added. Ensure complex multi-line statements with deep indentation are consistently handled.                                    |
| **3. Declared Variables**        | Medium         | **Yes**                                                                                                                                                                             | `DECLARE SECTION` blocks are captured, restored, and aligned. The implementation uses curly braces `{}` during marking to leverage `clang-format` for consistent indentation, which is later converted back to the original. |
| **4. Dynamic SQL (Host Variables)** | Medium         | **Partially**                                                                                                                                                                       | Dynamic SQL statements like `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` are supported to the extent they are handled as normal SQL statements. Context-aware restoration for host variables needs validation in dynamic scenarios.               |
| **5. SQL Cursor Management**     | Medium-High    | **No**                                                                                                                                                                              | No explicit handling of cursor declarations (`DECLARE CURSOR`), cursor operations (`OPEN`, `FETCH`, `CLOSE`), or associated variable bindings. These require lifecycle-aware capturing and restoration.                      |
| **6. PL/SQL Blocks**             | High           | **Partially**                                                                                                                                                                       | PL/SQL blocks enclosed in `EXEC SQL EXECUTE BEGIN ... END;` are treated as multi-line blocks. However, specific PL/SQL syntax (e.g., exception handling) needs validation for complex structures.                           |
| **7. Conditional/Iterative Constructs** | High           | **No**                                                                                                                                                                              | No explicit support for capturing or restoring logic like `IF`, `LOOP`, and other PL/SQL constructs within `EXEC SQL` blocks. These constructs require nested parsing logic for accurate restoration.                         |
| **8. Host Variable Arrays**      | High           | **No**                                                                                                                                                                              | No handling of host variable arrays (`FOR :n_rows` or `:id_array`). Parsing and restoring the dimensions and array bindings is required for proper support.                                                                 |
| **9. Runtime Error Handling**    | High           | **No**                                                                                                                                                                              | `EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR` directives are not specifically supported. These require context-sensitive capturing and linking to C error handling routines.                                                                 |
| **10. Complex Nested Structures** | Very High      | **No**                                                                                                                                                                              | Nested constructs combining multiple features (e.g., PL/SQL, cursors, dynamic SQL) are not explicitly supported. Capturing and restoring such combinations demands significant enhancements.                                |

### **Feature Gaps and Suggestions for Prioritization**

#### **Highest Priority:**
- **SQL Cursor Management:**
  - Essential for row-by-row processing.
  - Introduce parsing for `DECLARE CURSOR`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE`.

- **Dynamic SQL Validation:**
  - Ensure proper capturing and restoring of host variables in `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` statements.

#### **Medium Priority:**
- **Host Variable Arrays:**
  - Enable support for `FOR :n_rows` or array variable bindings.

- **Runtime Error Handling:**
  - Capture `WHENEVER SQLERROR` directives and link them to error handlers.

#### **Lower Priority:**
- **PL/SQL Enhancements:**
  - Expand handling for `IF`, `LOOP`, and other logic constructs in PL/SQL.

- **Complex Nested Structures:**
  - Address combined scenarios of cursors, PL/SQL, and host variables.

### **Conclusion**
The current implementation of `proc-format.py` provides robust support for simpler Pro*C constructs but needs further enhancements to handle more complex features like cursors, dynamic SQL validation, and nested PL/SQL constructs. By prioritizing cursor management and validating dynamic SQL, the tool can significantly extend its capabilities. Let me know if you'd like to tackle any specific feature next!
