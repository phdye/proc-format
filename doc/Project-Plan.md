### **Project Plan for Comprehensive Formatting Support in Pro*C Tool**

This project plan outlines the roadmap for implementing comprehensive support for capturing, restoring, and formatting Oracle Pro*C features in the `proc-format.py` tool.

---

## **1. Objectives**

1. Enable full support for all Pro*C features, from simple SQL statements to complex nested structures.
2. Ensure proper capturing, restoring, and context-aware formatting for all constructs.
3. Maintain a robust, extensible, and performant codebase.
4. Provide accurate diagnostics for unsupported or malformed SQL blocks.

---

## **2. Scope**

The project will focus on:
1. Capturing and restoring Pro*C features while ensuring their logical integrity.
2. Enhancing the tool to format embedded SQL constructs for consistent alignment.
3. Implementing support incrementally, starting with simpler features and progressing to more complex ones.

---

## **3. Deliverables**

1. **Feature Implementation:**
   - Full support for all Pro*C constructs, categorized by complexity.

2. **Documentation:**
   - User guide and developer documentation for the tool.
   - Detailed explanation of supported features and usage examples.

3. **Testing:**
   - Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all features.
   - Example input/output files to demonstrate proper functionality.

---

## **4. Implementation Plan**

### **4.1. Feature Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Core Features**
1. **Simple SQL Statements**
   - Fully capture and restore single-line `EXEC SQL` statements.
   - Verify proper formatting within their surrounding C code.

2. **Multi-Line SQL Statements**
   - Implement support for multi-line `EXEC SQL` blocks.
   - Ensure consistent indentation relative to surrounding context.

3. **Declared Variables (`DECLARE SECTION`)**
   - Capture and restore `DECLARE SECTION` blocks with variable definitions.
   - Use curly braces `{}` during intermediate processing for easy formatting.

---

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Constructs**
1. **Dynamic SQL**
   - Support for `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` statements.
   - Handle dynamic SQL with host variable bindings.

2. **SQL Cursor Management**
   - Parse `DECLARE CURSOR`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE` operations.
   - Ensure lifecycle-aware formatting for cursors and associated variables.

3. **PL/SQL Blocks**
   - Expand multi-line block support for `BEGIN ... END` constructs.
   - Support for PL/SQL-specific syntax, including nested `BEGIN` blocks.

---

#### **Phase 3: Complex Features**
1. **Conditional and Iterative Constructs**
   - Capture and restore logic like `IF`, `LOOP`, and `EXIT`.
   - Maintain proper alignment within multi-level constructs.

2. **Host Variable Arrays**
   - Support for bulk operations with host variable arrays (e.g., `FOR :n_rows`).
   - Validate dimensions and alignments during restoration.

3. **Runtime Error Handling**
   - Implement context-sensitive support for `WHENEVER SQLERROR`.
   - Ensure error handling directives link correctly with C code.

---

#### **Phase 4: Integration**
1. **Complex Nested Structures**
   - Combine features like cursors, dynamic SQL, PL/SQL, and error handling in nested contexts.
   - Ensure seamless capturing and restoration of all combined features.

---

### **4.2. Development Steps**

1. **Code Design:**
   - Modularize the current `proc-format.py` into feature-specific functions.
   - Introduce abstraction layers for SQL parsing, formatting, and restoration.

2. **Feature Implementation:**
   - Incrementally add features following the phases outlined above.
   - Perform rigorous testing after implementing each phase.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve diagnostics for unsupported features, syntax errors, and malformed constructs.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Develop a comprehensive test suite for unit and integration testing.
   - Validate the tool against diverse input files, including edge cases.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Enhance performance for large input files.
   - Minimize memory usage during SQL block processing.

### **4.3. Timeline**

| **Phase**              | **Features**                                         | **Duration** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1: Core Features** | Simple SQL, Multi-Line SQL, DECLARE SECTION         | 2 Weeks      |
| **Phase 2: Advanced Constructs** | Dynamic SQL, Cursor Management, PL/SQL Blocks | 3 Weeks      |
| **Phase 3: Complex Features** | Conditional Constructs, Arrays, Error Handling   | 3 Weeks      |
| **Phase 4: Integration**      | Complex Nested Structures                       | 2 Weeks      |

## **5. Risks and Mitigation**

1. **Syntax Variations:**
   - **Risk:** Variations in Pro*C syntax could lead to parsing errors.
   - **Mitigation:** Use a configurable parser to handle syntax differences.

2. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - **Risk:** Processing large files may cause performance issues.
   - **Mitigation:** Optimize SQL block storage and restoration algorithms.

3. **Incomplete Support for Features:**
   - **Risk:** Certain edge cases might not be handled initially.
   - **Mitigation:** Use extensive testing and user feedback to refine implementations.

---

## **6. Testing Strategy**

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test each feature independently.
   - Validate input/output for common and edge cases.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test combined features, such as dynamic SQL with cursors and PL/SQL.

3. **Regression Tests:**
   - Verify previously supported features remain unaffected by new changes.

4. **Example Files:**
   - Create a library of Pro*C files for testing various features and edge cases.

---

## **7. Resources Required**

1. **Technical Resources:**
   - Python environment with required libraries (e.g., `subprocess`, `re`).
   - Access to `clang-format` for intermediate processing.

2. **Human Resources:**
   - One developer for implementation and testing.
   - One tester for validation and feedback.

---

## **8. Success Criteria**

1. Full support for all Pro*C features outlined in the feature breakdown.
2. Consistent alignment and restoration of embedded SQL constructs.
3. Comprehensive testing coverage with no major unresolved issues.
4. Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
